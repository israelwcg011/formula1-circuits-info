# Formula 1 Circuits Info
### Introduction

In this project I create a simple WEBGIS to show the location of all Circuits that Formula 1 ever raced. You can see the locations as blue markers and can interact with them by clicking on them, opening a left menu that shows more info.

### Technologies used

To create this project I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The JavaScript libraries used are: [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) to handle map logic, and the [left-sidebar](https://github.com/Turbo87/leaflet-sidebar/tree/master) package, created by [Turbo87](https://github.com/Turbo87). The Formula 1 dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).
